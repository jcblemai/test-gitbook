# Tutorials

(Many examples/vignettes using simplified models. Configs will be provided for each)

### Non-inference

* Simple 1 population SIR
* SIR + more compartments?
* SIR + multiple populations
* SIR + outcomes
* SIR + multiple age groups
* SIR + multiple strains
* SIR + time dependent interventions
* Full COVID-19 model?

### Inference

* SIR + outcomes only
* SIR + outcomes + interventions
* SIR + outcomes + interventions + subpopulations
* Fitting multiple outcomes
* Different likelihood functions?
* Hierarchical likelihood?
* Full COVID-19 model?
